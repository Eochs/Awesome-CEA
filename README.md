## Case Studies

### Bowery Farming
- [Sam Swift: AI Farming](https://youtu.be/chfIo1O0Cpk)
- [Marianne Hoogeveen: Plant Factory](https://youtu.be/qOKpWU8vvM8)

## Machine Learning and AI

### Image Recognition
- [Deep Learning for Biologists with Keras](https://github.com/totti0223/deep_learning_for_biologists_with_keras) - Tutorials for deep learning based analysis (mainly) on biological relavent themes.
- [PlantCV](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv) - Plant phenotyping software using computer vision.

### Constraint Programming
During resource allocation, constraint programming can be used to allocate limited resources such as space, water, nutrients, and energy among different crops and to ensure that the allocation satisfies certain constraints such as the total amount of resources available, the needs of the crops, and the quality of the final product.

### Books
- "The Martian" by Andy Weir. In Chapter 13 Mark Watney begins his experiment to grow potatoes using Martian soil, his own feces, and water. The process is detailed, from building the greenhouse to preparing the soil, and culminates in the successful growth of potato plants.
- "Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson. Agriculture plays a significant role in the story, as the colonists must learn to grow food in the harsh Martian environment.
- "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" by Robert A. Heinlein. A group of rebels living on the Moon must rely on farming to sustain themselves in their struggle for independence from Earth. Discusses economics of farming and sustainability issues of exporting water in the form of crops.
- "Leviathan Wakes" by James S. A. Corey. Features a habitat on an asteroid with large hydroponic farms that use recycled water and artificial light to grow crops. The process of farming in this environment is described in detail, as well as the challenges of keeping the crops healthy and productive.
